		  Mini Project using Spring Cloud (API BackEnd)

1. Eureka Server : 
   It is a Register, it holds all MS# details
   ServiceInstances (serviceid + InstanceId + HOST + PORT + LF)
   ..etc

> Every MS# Must be register with eureka.
> Even Gateway Application should be register with eureka.
> one MS# (or) Gateway can fetch other MS# details from Eureka based on serviceid

2. Config Server :
> All Common Key-Val of MS# must be kept in one common place
  ie GitHub account and access using one server ie 'Config server'.
> At MS# level provide Config Client Dependency and location of Config Server

3. Admin Server :
> To make Visual Actuator service Results of every MS#
> Actuator gives services like health, beans, info, mappings, cache, schedulings..etc
> At Every MS# We add Admin client and Admin Server location.

4. MS# Applications:
> Product Service
> Auth Service (Register and Login)

5. Gateway Application:
