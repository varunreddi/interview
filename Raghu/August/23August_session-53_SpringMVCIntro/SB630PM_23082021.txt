Spring WEB MVC Workflow:-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8MtjB0Ru0E

			  Spring Boot - WEB MVC

M - Model      : Data (Primitive, Object, Collection)
V - View       : User Interface (Display) [HTML/JSP/Thymeleaf]
C - Controller : Class - That process Http Request.

		-----------------------------------------
Q) In how many ways End User can make request using Web Browser?
A) 3 ways
  I. Enter URL in addressbar (GET)
 II. Click on HyperLink (<a>)(GET)
III. Form Submit             (GET/POST)

*) In Java there can be no web application implemented without Servlets API.

*) FrontController[FC](Concept name) is the one which takes request and returns
   response (Entry and exit gate for our application)

*) FC is implemented using Servlet concept, named as DispatcherServlet
   by Spring WEB MVC. 

*) Controller is a class, that contains request processing logic.
   [main java code for HTTP exist in Controller only]

Gmail App: User, Inbox, Drafts, Settings ...etc Modules
Controller : UserController, InboxController, DraftsController, SettingController

              1 Module[operation] - 1 Controller(methods)

*) In a Project multiple Controllers exist. They are connected/mapped with
   Path/URL and Http Method(GET/POST)

*) HandlerMapping it is a Map internally, which stores all details for
   every controller, FC takes help of this Map to find our Controller method.

                         example HandlerMapping
    +-------------------------------+----------------------------+
    |        KEY (URL+HTTP METHOD)  |  VALUE (CLASS/METHOD)      |
    +-------------------------------+----------------------------+
       /emp/save  + POST              EmployeeController#create()

       /admin/export + GET            AdminController#exportExcel()

    +-------------------------------+----------------------------+

---> Programmer/Developer is writing Controller class
---> Spring Container is creating Object.
---> FrontController is execting controller method when request is received.

*) Controller method is exuected by FC, Controller process the request
  and returns ViewName (Only fileName, no Extension no Location)

*) FC reads ViewName and uses ViewResolver Help to find full ViewPage name
    
    View Resolver provide prefix(file location) and suffix(file extension)

   ex:  ViewPage  = prefix + viewName + suffix
                   /mypages/  Welcome    .jsp

*) Now, Finally executing ViewPage.
   But View page reads data from Model Memory (Map) shared by Controller.

   By using EL(+JSTL) ViewPage reads data and replace keys with values
   (Data Rendering)
==================================================================
Q) Can browser understand
    Java(Servlets/JSP) -- NO
    .net(ASP/C#)    ---   NO

    HTML/CSS/JS     ---- YES
    Angular         ---- No
      Code --> .ts ->JS-> Build + Minified


Servlet --- CATALINA
JSP     --- JASPER
...etc
==================================================================
Q) Why not Controller is returning full Viewname?
A) Controller wants be independent of UI technologies.
   No need of Re-compile and build if we move from one 
   UI concept to another one.
   
   
   
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							FOR ME
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever we make request, request goes to front controller.FC behaves like entry 
and exit gate.
It is implemented by servlets concepts using Servelets named Dispatcher Servlet.

Dispatcher servlet communicated with Handler Mapper to get the details of Controller method
Dispatcher Servlet communicated the Controller. Controller Process the request and puts data in the model
and returns viewName.
DispatcherServelet takes the viewname and it communicate the viewResolver to get the prefix(view path) and
suffix(extension)
Then Dispatcher Servlet exexcutes View and returns Html format.
