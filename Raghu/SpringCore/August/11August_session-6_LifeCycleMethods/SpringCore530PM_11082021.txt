			      Spring LifeCycle Methods

*) Method and LifeCycle Method:-
  Method : It is used to execute a task, defined and called mostly by programmer.
  LifeCycle Methods : Types are pre-defined, executed by f/w or container
			while creating or destroying objects.

*) Adv Java Servlets (3): init, service, destory 

*) in Spring F/w 2 life cycle methods exist: (optional to use)
   a. Init method    
   b. Destory method

> Both are executed by Spring Container, not be programmer.
> But Configuration must be done by programmer
> Using these methods are optional.
> Executed once per object.

Init/Destory method  Syntax:-

  public void <methodName>() {
     //logic 
  }

> Must return void (taken by Container so no use)
> Must have Zero Params 
> Init Logic is related : Files data, Streams, Connection Pool, 
                      Cache Creation..etc
> Destory Logic is related : 
       close files, clear stream, close Pool, diconnect Cache..etc

> XML Configuration looks Like:
<bean  id=""  class=""  init-method="_____"  destory-method="______">
  ...
</bean>
