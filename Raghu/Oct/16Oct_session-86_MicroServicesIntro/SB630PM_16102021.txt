SOA : Service Oriented Architecture.

			MediaType Annotations

*) @RequestBody  : Http Request Body (XML/JSON) is taken into one Object Format
			this is given as method parameter / Input.

*) @ResponseBody : ReturnType (Object) is converted into XML/JSON and placed
			inside Http Response Body Section / Output.

*) These works on non-String type (ex: ClassType, CollectionType).
*) When we apply @RestController by default it provides @ResponseBody.


Microservices:-
 An independent deployable component that supports 
 Intra-Communication, Load Balace.


=> Monolithic Application = all Modules/services together as one application.
=> Microservices Application = one module/service as one project
			and support inter-link


*) Monolithic Limitations :-
a) Must re-build and re-deploy in case of single module modification.

Sol#
=> Microservices makes app independent, no need to re-build all modules/services.

b) These are not reliable (Single Point Failure), if one module is
   failed that may cause other modules even problem.

Sol#
=> Microservices makes app independent, effect rate will be very less.


c) Enhancements/adding new technologies may need re-design of application
   (or may not suitable to add).

Sol# Only add new service and link with RestWebservices(XML/JSON)


d) As No.of Modules gets increased then Code Size and bug rate gets increased.

Sol# Here not, they are high cohesion and less coupling.

e) Downtime/Deployment time will be more incase of App is verybig.

Sol# All are paralllel deployable components.
