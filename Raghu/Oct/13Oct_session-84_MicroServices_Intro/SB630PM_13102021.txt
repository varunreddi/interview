				Microservices

Application -- Collection of services
Project     -- Collection of Module

Email Application = Services ( User, Inbox, Compose and send, Sent Mail, Drafts...)
Amazon Application = Services ( User, Search, Cart, Payment, Track, Feedback..etc)

Monolithic Applications:-
  Creating one application with collection of services together as
  single Unit / single deployable component.

Docker:-

*) Advantages :-
a) It follows Layers Design (PL/SL/DAL/IL) , so Simple to develop.
b) Testing is easy for QA team even using test tools (ex: Selenium)
c) Easy to deploy and manage (log files, error, memory issues..etc)
d) Scaling of Application can also be done easily.

*) Limitations :-
a) Must re-build and re-deploy in case of single module modification.
b) These are not reliable (Single Point Failure), if one module is
   failed that may cause other modules even problem.
c) Enhancements/adding new technologies may need re-design of application
   (or may not suitable to add).
d) As No.of Modules gets increased then Code Size and bug rate gets increased.
e) Downtime/Deployment time will be more incase of App is verybig.


*) Monolithic application is good incase of no.of modules are less.


Horizontal Scale -- one more instance (multiple instances)
Vertical Scale -- h/w config  ( Enhance Hardware/Network configuration)

LoadFactor = No.of Req/Max Req

*) Build and Deploy

Cloud Computing and Spring Cloud

To deploy application --Env Required- Cloud Couputing
